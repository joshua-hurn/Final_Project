              The ultimate purpose of a prosthesis is to make your goals
              attainable & your everyday life easier. It is a tool otherwise
              known as an artificial replacement for a missing limb or body part
              that can help you regain independence after an amputation. If a
              prosthesis would bring your desires more within reach, you should
              consult with specialized physicians to reach a conclusion. There
              are many different fittings, types & styles, so everyone’s
              preference will be different. Finding the right prosthetic is only
              half of the battle. Please remember that physical therapy is a key
              component of the process.

              After amputation, your physician should assist you with the
              fitting process. You will be required to wear a compression
              garment and/or a series of casts to prepare your limb for a
              prosthetic. The approximate timing of this process is 6-8 weeks
              following your surgery. Once your surgeon has cleared your status,
              you may proceed with ordering your customized limb. This part of
              the process is done by a prosthetist, a professional trained to
              fit patients with prosthetic device. He/she will also make
              adjustments and recommendations based on your personal preferences
              & needs. After receiving your prosthesis, you will then report to
              a physical therapist.

              Depending on the situation, you may receive a temporary device
              immediately following your surgery. Some individuals may have to
              wait a few weeks post surgery. Since the prosthetic fitting
              doesn’t typically begin until three months post-surgery, your
              temporary can help you adjust to your new lifestyle. Once your
              incision has healed, your physician will clear you to start the
              fitting process.

              The answer to this question is extremely variable. The type of
              device, amputation level, size, and construction all play a vital
              part in the total price of the prosthesis. In most cases, your
              device will be covered by your insurance plan. Some plans will
              likely cover the whole cost of the device. Be sure to be in close
              contact with your insurance provider to guarantee an outcome you
              are pleased with. Understand that this process will include a
              multitude of phone calls & plenty of reading. You must be your own
              advocate. It’s also wise to have a loved one help you throughout
              this process. When it comes down to understanding documentation,
              there may be something you looked over & it’s always great to have
              someone else with your best interest at heart to help deliberate
              your decision making. Make sure that your policy has prosthetic
              coverage & be aware of all limitations and exclusions. Also, be
              positive in knowing that your prosthetist will assist you with fit
              and alignment until you are comfortable & the pricing for this
              should be bundled with the total cost of your device. This is to
              be sure that you are not paying out monies for two separate
              insurance claims or missing out on things that you could have
              received for $0 out-of-pocket.

              I think most people understand that physical preparation is a
              must. Exercising to build the muscles and learning to balance your
              equilibrium will be a huge help. Be sure to mold the amputated
              limb to maintain the proper shape. However, your mental health is
              also extremely important. Daily affirmations and therapy will help
              you work through your emotions and feelings. Amputation &
              prosthesis is serious stuff. Don’t forget about your mental
              stability along the way.

              It is imperative that you follow-up with your prosthetist to

              swelling and pressure areas. These things are normal, but you want
              to be sure that you won’t encounter critical issues down the road.
              Discomfort will only get worse if you are not taking your recovery

              A prosthesis can last anywhere from months to years. It all
              depends upon one’s age, activity level, growth, & etc. Shortly
              after amputation, your limb may experience alot of change. It is
              very likely that your amputated limb will shrink which will cause
              a difference in the way that it fits. When this happens, the
              prosthetist will have to consider socket alterations, replacement
              sockets, & you may have to wear thicker socks to compensate for
              the extra space.

              Most devices contain parts and components that may rust if exposed
              to excess moisture. The only way to prevent this is to protect
              your device from getting wet. There are covers to protect your
              devices from things like spills, precipitation, & humidity. There
              are also devices that are especially made for water activities
              like swimming, canoeing, and surfing.
